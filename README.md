## 📌 Overview

Spring Mini CRM is a RESTful API developed as a technical challenge. The project simulates a simple CRM system focused on **clients and their contacts**, following good backend practices with Spring Boot.

The application was designed with clean architecture, clear separation of responsibilities, and is ready for future features such as authentication and authorization.
